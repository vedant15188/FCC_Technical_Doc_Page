                <b>React </b>is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our
                <a href="https://reactjs.org" class="link">homepage</a> or in <a class="link" href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"> the tutorial.</a>
            </p><br><br>

            <h2>Try React</h2><br>
            <p>
                React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React,
                add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2>Online Playgrounds</h2><br>
            <p>
                If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on
                <a class="link" href="https://codepen.io"> CodePen</a> or <a class="link" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/new"> CodeSandbox</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download
                <a class="link" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html">this HTML file</a>,
                edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2>Learn React</h2><br>
            <p>
                People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach,
                we hope you’ll find this section helpful.<br>
            </p><br>
            <h3>Familiarity with Javascript</h3><br>
            <p>
                The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and
                JavaScript at the same time. We recommend going through this JavaScript overview shown below to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour
                but you will feel more confident learning React.
            </p><br>

                <h5>Tip</h5>

                <p>
                    Whenever you get confused by something in JavaScript,
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" class="link"> MDN</a> and <a href="http://javascript.info/" class="link"> javascript.info</a>
                    are great websites to check. There are also <a href="https://reactjs.org/community/support.html" class="link"> community support forums</a> where you can ask for help.
                </p>
            </div><br><br>

            <h2 id="main-concepts">Getting Started</h2><br>
            <p>
                In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation
                This guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts step by step. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial.
                You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h3><br>
            <p>
                React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going
                through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an
                hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.
            </p><br>
            <h3>JSX</h3><br>
            <p>
                React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared
                for display. React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to
                show more useful error and warning messages. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
                After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Rendering Elements</h3><br>
            <p>
                Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of
                updating the DOM to match the React elements. To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to <b>ReactDOM.render()</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie:
                it represents the UI at a certain point in time. React Only Updates What’s Necessary
            </p><br>
            <h3>Components and Props</h3><br>
            <p>
                Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
                This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html" class="link"> detailed component API reference here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
                The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function. You can also use an ES6 class to define a component.
                Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 id="Advanced">Advanced Guides</h2><br>
            <p>
                React and <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components"> Web Components</a> are built to solve different problems. Web Components provide
                strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary.
                As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components, or to use Web Components in React, or both.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Higher-Order Components</h3><br>
            <p>
                A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se.
                They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.
                Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
            </p><br>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <h5>Note</h5>

                <p>
                    We previously recommended mixins as a way to handle cross-cutting concerns. We’ve since realized that mixins create more trouble than they are worth.
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" class="link"> Read More</a> about why we’ve moved away from mixins and how you can
                    transition your existing components.
                </p>
            </div><br>

            <h3>Render Props</h3><br>
            <p>
                The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
                A render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render. One interesting thing to note about render props is that you can implement most
                higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Forwarding Refs</h3><br>
            <p>
                Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html" class="link"> ref</a> through a component to
                one of its children. This is typically not necessary for most components in the application. However, it can be useful for some kinds of components,
                especially in reusable component libraries. The most common scenarios are described below.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Forwarding refs to DOM components</li>
                <li>Forwarding refs in higher-order components</li>
                <li>Displaying a custom name in DevTools</li>
            </ol><br><br>

            <h2 id="api">React Top-Level API</h2><br>
            <p>
                React is the entry point to the React library. If you load React from a <b>&lt;script&gt;</b> tag, these top-level APIs are available on the React global.
                If you use ES6 with npm, you can write <b>import React from 'react'</b>. If you use ES5 with npm, you can write <b>var React = require('react')</b>.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3><br>
            <h4>Components</h4><br>
            <p>
                React components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
                React components can be defined by subclassing React.Component or React.PureComponent.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Creating React Elements</h4><br>
            <p>
                We recommend using JSX to describe what your UI should look like. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement().
                See <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html" class="link"> Using React without JSX</a> for more information.
            </p>
            <h4>Transforming Elements</h4><br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#cloneelement" class="link">cloneElement()</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#isvalidelement" class="link">isValidElement()</a></li>

            </ul><br>
            <h4>Fragments</h4><br>
            <p>
                React also provides a component for rendering multiple elements without a wrapper. See
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactfragment" class="link">React.Fragment</a>
            </p><br>
            <h4>Refs</h4><br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcreateref" class="link">React.createRef</a></li>

            </ul><br>
            <h4>Suspense</h4><br>
            <p>
                Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering.
                Today, Suspense only supports one use case: <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy" class="link">loading components dynamically with React.lazy</a>.
                In the future, it will support other use cases like data fetching.

            <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><br><br>
            <h3>Is there a recommended way to structure React projects?</h3><br>
            <p>React doesn’t have opinions on how you put files into folders. That said there are a few common approaches popular in the ecosystem you may want to consider.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grouping by features or routes</li>
                <li>Grouping by file type</li>
                <li>Avoid too much nesting</li>
                <li>Don’t overthink it</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h3>How do I add CSS classes to components?</h3><br>
            <p>Pass a string as the className prop.</p><br>

            <h3>Can I use inline styles?</h3><br>
            <p>Yes, see the docs on styling <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style" class="link">here</a>.</p><br>

            <h3>Can I do animations in React?</h3><br>
            <p>
                React can be used to power animations. See
                <a href="https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/" class="link"> React Transition Group</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion" class="link"> React Motion</a>, for examples.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Where in the component lifecycle should I make an AJAX call?</h3><br>
            <p>You should populate data with AJAX calls in the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#mounting" class="link"> componentDidMount</a> lifecycle method.
                 This is so you can use setState to update your component when the data is retrieved.</p><br>

            <h3>Do I need to use JSX with React?</h3><br>
            <p>No! Check out <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html" class="link"> “React Without JSX”</a> to learn more.</p><br><br>
